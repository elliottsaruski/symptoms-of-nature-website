      "“Not afraid of nostalgia and where abstract electronic music once took us, Sohn Jamal reshapes the familiar within unfamiliar channels and is very much present in the now.” - Pietro Da Sacco, Igloomag <br/> Sohn Jamal (real name John Small) stands out as an artist that consistently pushes the limits of electronic music. Renowned for his avant-garde aesthetic, he expertly combines components from numerous subgenres to produce a sound that is all his own. He creates a tapestry of captivating auditory environments by drawing inspiration from beat music, footwork, ambient, jazz and IDM. <br/> Having originally grown up in Tokyo, Japan, Small relocated to Miami in 2014 to study jazz guitar. His first album, “Suzy”, came out in 2018 on vinyl under Night Young. After releasing a series of singles and eps digitally through various Miami labels and his own imprint TY Tapes, he released his second album “Scroo Amethyst” in 2022 under Schematic Music Company. A promo single “UR21201820” was released in anticipation of the project. <br/> In 2023, Small released two collaborative EPs. The first, “Simhuman Fortitude”, was with Tokyo-based IDM/glitch pop artist Serph, which charted at number 4 on the iTunes electronic music charts in Japan. The second, “Don't Let the Body Up”, was with Low End Resorts, a newer alias of Romulo Del Castillo (Soul Oddity, Phoenecia) and Nick Forte through Schematic. <br/> As a producer, DJ and multi-instrumentalist, he has supported for artists such as Machinedrum, Flying Lotus, Vegyn, Iglooghost, Shinichiro Yokota, Deantoni Parks, Eevee, Khruangbin, and Plaid.",

In iconography, it's the halo that signifies divine power. My way of elaborating on this connection is to use it as a brand for my music and art, like a memento. I've released 30-40 tracks, most of them singles, with 2 EPs, 'Breach' and 'PASSAGE,' as well as an art book, 'WRECCA,' and have performed all over the U.S. at clubs and festivals.",
